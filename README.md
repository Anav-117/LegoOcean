# A Lego Ocean

A GPU version of the marching cubes algorithm to implement real-time meshing of dynamic scalar fields. 
Using this technique we can generate high quality meshes incredibly quickly out generic 3D data clouds. Implemeting this on a series of trignometric waves, we can generate an ocean of Legos!
