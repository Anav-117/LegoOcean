# A Lego Ocean

A GPU version of the marching cubes algorithm to implement real-time meshing of dynamic scalar fields. 
Using this technique we can generate high-quality meshes incredibly quickly out of generic 3D data clouds. Implementing this on a series of trigonometric waves, we can generate an ocean of Legos!
